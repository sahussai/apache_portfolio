          I am an Electrical Engineering graduate from the University of
          Alberta. I have just recently completed my MSc. in Signals and Image
          Processing, and I am now in the process of looking for work. I have a
          strong passion for web development, and I am constantly looking to
          upgrade my skills. I am working towards becoming a full stack
          developer. With the programming skills I've honed over the years in my
          undergraduate and graduate classes, along with my increasing knowledge
          of web development, I want to create enagaging, intuitive, and elegant
          designs and applications that work with the user to accomplish any
          task.

          This portion is a work in progress. I will be periodically updating
          this page, as my projects develop. I work on things that interest me,
          and my interests are varied. I typically try to balance out the number
          of front-end projects along with back-end projects. I also like
          tinkering with AWS and GCP from time to time.

              This portfolio was made for two purposes. Firstly, I wanted to
              have my own website up and running to experience all the different
              aspects of running a website. Because of that, I chose not to host
              this website using a professional hosting domain. Rather, I chose
              to host this website via Amazon Web Services (AWS), using their
              EC2 service. I got to play around with the inner workings of how
              the server is set up, and I got to decide which web server I was
              using. Currently, I am running this website on a Apache web
              server, but I plan to switch it to a Node.js server in the near
              future.
              <br />
              <br />
              I also wanted a platform where I could periodically collect my
              work in a more presentable fashion than just Github. As I complete
              more and more projects, I plan to display my results here for
              others and for myself.

              App This book-keeping app was designed to work as a tool to help a
              school program manage the collection of fees, as well as other
              administrative tasks. It was initally built as a desktop
              application using Python, and SQLite, but was later changed to a
              web-based platform. It is built using Node.js and MongoDB on the
              back-end, and Bootstrap 4 for styling.
